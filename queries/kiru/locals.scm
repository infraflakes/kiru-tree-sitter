; Local scope and binding queries for kiru.
;
; Names are read top-down and a local shadows an outer binding. A function is
; a scope, so its parameters are visible throughout its body. A block is a
; scope for the `txt`, `rec`, and `list` bindings it declares. Each `case` arm
; is its own scope that still sees the enclosing body. A `for` body is its own
; scope.
