; Syntax highlighting for kiru.
;
; The palette is deliberately small. Tree-sitter's own guidance is that an
; entity should be colored the same wherever it appears, so a name never
; changes color between its declaration, its uses and its call sites, and a
; namespace is colored like any other name. Color is spent only on what a
; reader scans a file for: comments, strings, the keywords that shape a run,
; the three value kinds, and the names you can call. Every other name, whether
; a value, a parameter, a field, a record key or a namespace, shares one color.
;
; The captures are the standard Neovim names, so any colorscheme that supports
; Tree-sitter highlighting works without extra groups. Neovim applies patterns
; in order, so a general capture comes first and the more specific capture that
; shares a node comes later and wins.

; Comments and strings.
(comment) @comment
(string) @string
